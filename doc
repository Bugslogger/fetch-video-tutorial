In this video we will get data from API's and display on web page.

we will see: 1. fetch() 2. axios 3. XHR

First we will see `Fetch()`
Here i'm using Reactjs v.18 and bootstrap v.5.0

Step 1:
in function.js file i will create a function and inside the function i will write
fetch().
Now import it in App.js/App.jsx [whereever you want to fetch data from API import `FetchDataUsingFetchMethod()` in that file.]
Step 2:
For API i will use json placeholder which is fake API to get some fake data.
Now let's head to browser.
Step 3:
Display data in table.
store data from API into state.
Now displaying multiple data.

    async/await (sorry i forgot about it.)
    let see it.

Step 4:
We have seen GET.
now we will perform PUT, POST, and DELETE.

    I have made little changes in fetch function in `function.js``
    let POST something.
    create A button to post data on click.
    Now let test it.
    out data is posted with id `101`
    let try to fetch our data.
    now let test it.
    Ok, i think it's not updating on server.

Now, nest let see PUT method
Next is DELETE method.

HERE WE HAVE COMPLETED FETCH METHOD we have covered basic fetch methods.

In this video we have seen
fetch() method and data binding.

In this video we will see XHR [XmlHttpRequest]

Step 1:
create function for XHR in fucntion.js.
GET, POST, DELETE.

    Great we have seen XHR.
    Note: XHR is old technic to fetch data with api from server.
    nowdays molstly we use fetch or axios

    In next video we will see AXIOS.
